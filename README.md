# supreme-tools-basket
* A candy basket for setting up a new dev env, with tools and configurations. E.g vim, bash, java *

This repo is used for gather tools and configuration in one place, so that we are easier to setup a new development env.
Also making it easier to collaborate about which tools we use.
